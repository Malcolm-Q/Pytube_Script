# Pytube_Script
A quick and ugly script I made for my friends to safely download youtube videos or audio.

Do you hate using the ever changing sketchy youtube video/audio downloader websites? Here's a very simple cmd line script to put those days behind you.

**NOTE:**
```
pyinstaller --onefile youtube_downloader.py
``` 
will make a ~6mb distributable .exe

Alternatively do:
```
python youtube_downloader.py
```
